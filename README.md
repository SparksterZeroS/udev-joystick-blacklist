# udev-joystick-blacklist

*A list of devices to blacklist as joysticks/controllers.*

## Brief

This repository is essentially a list of devices that are blacklisted from be detected as some sort of game controller.  
A need for a fix like this arrises when trying to play video games that expect the first detected game controller to... actually be a game controller.  
As such, this project, [udev-joystick-blacklist](https://github.com/denilsonsa/udev-joystick-blacklist) by [@denilsonsa on Github](https://github.com/denilsonsa) was born.

There are several [forks](https://github.com/denilsonsa/udev-joystick-blacklist/forks) that do continue the legacy of the original project. However, this is just one of them.
